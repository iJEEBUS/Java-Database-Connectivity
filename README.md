# Java-Database-Connectivity
Java CLI application that communicates with a locally-hosted MySQL database.
Highlights the simplistic nature of JDBC when it comes to storing an applications data persistently.

<b>Currently you can:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Insert a new student to the database.</li>
  <li>Dump the entire contents of the database to your console.</li>
</ul>
